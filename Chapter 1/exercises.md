# 1. 

Define in your own words: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence, (c) agent, (d) rationality, (e) logical reasoning.

## Answer

- __Intelligence__: A mechanism by which an agent manipulated outward information in order to meet a certain goal.
- __Artificial Intelligence__: Methods for making machines act intelligently: i.e., make sensible decisions in order to meet cetain goals. This methods are not programmed explicitly in the machine.
- __Agent__: An entity which tries to meet cetain goals for a given problem.
- __Rationality__: The ability to reflect and give reasons for choosing between different alternatives.
- __Logical Reasoning__: A type of reasoning that must follow a given set of rules.


# 2. 

Read Turingâ€™s original paper on AI Turing:1950 .In the paper, he discusses several objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years?

# Answer

## Objections

- The theological objection carries little weight. There is no place for such an objection in modern science. His refutation is kind of weird, but it makes sense as he was trying to refute it theologically also.
- The 'heads in the sand' objection. There are still some concerns regarding machines that could achieve human-like intelligence, and their possible dangers. I don't think this is addressed properly by Turing.
