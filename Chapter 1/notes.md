# 1. Introduction

- Unifying theme of the book: the idea of implementing intelligent agents. AI is then the attempt to build this intelligent entities.
- Agents implements function which map percept sequence to actions.
- AI is relevant to any intellectual taks, i.e., it is an universal field.
- AI can be defined as thinking humanly, acting humanly, thinking rationally or acting rationally.
- __Turing Test__: Designed to provide an operational definition of intelligence (a computer passes the Turing test if a human can't determine if the test taker was a human or a computer). In order for a program to pass the Turing test, it must possess: NLP, Knowledge representation, automated reasoning, machine learning.
- __Total Turing Test__: Turing Test + Interaction with a video feed and manipulation of certain physical objects. This also requieres computer vision and robotics. 
- The disciplines necessary for Total Turing Test combine most of AI.
- Cognitive Science construct precise testable theories of the human mind.
- __Logicists__: Current in AI which build proble solver in logical notation.
- __"Laws of tought approach"__: Rational agents, emphasis on correct inferences.
- __Limited Rationality__: Acting appropiately with constrained time.
- For AI to be where it is today, advances in philosophy, mathematics, economics, neuroscience, psychology, computer engineering, control theory, cybernetics and linguistics were made.
- First AI research was McCulloch and Pitts (1943), based on neural structures. Later, Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first Neural Network computed in 1950.
- Alan Turing set out a programme for AI in 1950. 
- The term AI is born, coined by McCarthy who organized a two-month workshop at Dartmouth. Newell and Simon stole the show in the conference with a Logic Solver.
- After its inception, AI saw breakthrough after breakthrough on specific problems, but it was hampered by scarse and expensive computer resources.
- John McCarthy creates LISP in 1958.
- Optimism in AI was met by little progress (60s-70s).
- Knowledge intensive systems developed for specific problems start to trive (Expert Systems).
- Expert systems were a billion dollar industry that failed to deliver on its promises. We enter the AI winter.
- Neural Networks return. Rise of the connectionist models, competitors to the symbolic and logicist approaches.
- AI booms and becomes more rigurous. Embraces the advances made in control theory and statistics.
- Bayesian Networks emerge to deal with uncertainty.
- Despite sucesses, infulential founders have expresed discomfort with the direction AI is following recently: it is good for indificual tasks but not good for general reasoning.
- In the age of big data, more emphasis on data than on algorithms.
