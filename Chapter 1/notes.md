- __Turing Test__: Designed to provide an operational definition of intelligence (a computer passes the Turing test if a human can't determine if the test taker was a human or a computer). In order for a program to pass the Turing test, it must possess: NLP, Knowledge representation, automated reasoning, machine learning.
- __Total Turing Test__: Turing Test + Interaction with a video feed and manipulation of certain physical objects. This also requieres computer vision and robotics.
